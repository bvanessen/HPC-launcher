Regression tests for three resource-validation defects, all in
``hpc_launcher/systems/configure.py``:

* **The oversubscription warning.** The GPU-oversubscription check used to
  log a message claiming "Job will not launch" at ``logger.info``
  (invisible at default verbosity) and then return the uncorrected,
  oversubscribed configuration anyway -- an outcome the message did not
  actually enforce. It is now a ``logger.warning`` (visible by default)
  that no longer asserts an outcome it does not enforce. It deliberately
  still does *not* raise or silently clamp the values in this specific
  branch -- see the docstring on
  ``test_gpu_oversubscription_is_now_a_visible_warning`` for why not,
  which is also the reason this fix is a warning rather than a
  ``ValueError`` unlike the division below.

* **Dividing by a zero GPU memory size.** ``--gpumem-at-least`` divided by
  ``system_params.mem_per_gpu`` unconditionally, which is exactly ``0`` on
  the "Generic CPU" autodetect fallback (and on any other
  GPU-less/unrecognized host), producing a bare ``ZeroDivisionError``
  traceback instead of an actionable error.

* **Mutating a shared template.** CLI ``--system-params``/``-p`` overrides wrote directly into the
  ``__dict__`` of whatever ``SystemParams`` instance
  ``system.system_parameters()`` returned. Several of those instances
  are module-level singletons deliberately reused as the value for many
  systems/queues (e.g. ``_mi300a_node`` in ``el_capitan_family.py``
  backs every queue on tuolumne, elcap, rzadams and tenaya, plus
  tioga's ``mi300a`` queue) -- so the override corrupted the shared
  template for the rest of the process's lifetime, not just the one job
  that requested it. This is unreachable through a single normal CLI
  invocation (both CLI entry points call ``configure_launch()`` exactly
  once and exit), but a pytest process -- like this one -- calls it more
  than once, which is exactly the reproducing condition.

    is individually valid (<= gpus_per_node), so the auto-correction branch
    at configure.py:112-114 is skipped, but ``procs_per_node * gpus_per_proc``

    invisible at the default ``WARNING`` verbosity floor set by
    ``launch_helpers.setup_logging()`` -- with a message claiming "Job
    will not launch", while ``configure_launch()`` returned the
    uncorrected, oversubscribed tuple regardless. That is a false
    assertion: the job *does* launch.

    This exact input shape is also exercised as a *passing* assertion in
    ``tests/launch_config_test.py::test_launch_config`` (the very first
    case, "User-specified procs_per_node", and again later in the same
